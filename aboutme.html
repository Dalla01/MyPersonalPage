                    Hello everyone!
                    My name is André Garcia and here's a little bit about my academic education and qualification. 
                    In the end of 2018, Agronomist graduated from Instituto Federal do Espírito Santo - IFES 
                    Campus Santa Teresa, where I was developed projects and researches related to irrigation 
                    management and agrometeorology, becoming a member of the research group IRRIFES lead by 
                    Dr. Gustavo Haddad, which focuses on studies related to irrigation and water resources. 
                    Still in graduation, I had the opportunity to do an internship at a meteorological microstation
                     in which I was responsible for processing and organizing the database, as well as providing it
                      to users. In 2021 I was concluded my Master's degree at the Graduate Program in Vegetal 
                      Production at the Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro - UENF, in the 
                      concentration area of irrigated agriculture and had agrometeorology as research line,
                       surpervised by Dr. José Carlos Mendonça. My research focused in verify the feasilbility of 
                       Conilon coffee cultivation in the Northern of Rio de Janeiro based on drip irrigation and 
                       climate parameters. Between 2019 and 2021, I carried out a Specialization in Occupational 
                       Safety, in which I developed a research to identify occupational risk areas in rural 
                       properties using remote sensing images.
                       Since 2021 to currently, I'm PhD candidate at Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - 
                       INPE, where develop research about agricultural remote sense surpervised by Dr Ieda Sanches,
                        and integrate the Agricultural Remote Sensing Laboratory - AgriRS. Basically my study 
                        focus on irrigated rice mapping using optical and microwave (SAR) sensors. In the first 
                        quarter of 2023 I became a member of International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote 
                        Sensing - ISPRS.
